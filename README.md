# BaseyMcBaseFace

BaseyMcBaseFace is a parametric simulation of a moon base. It makes use of research from the International Space Station to model the behaviour and dynamics of a lunar base.

The system contains a robust component framework which enables you to easily extend it with additional base parts. It uses the Denavit-Hartenberg Equations of State to provide realistic thermodynamic simulation of the base. The implementation for this is provided by CoolProp (https://github.com/CoolProp).

This was a joint project for a Mechanical Engineering Honours Thesis at the University of Adelaide by myself, Adam Storey, and Lachlan Richter.
